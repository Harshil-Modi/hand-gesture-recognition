# Hand Gesture Recognition

---

![Featured Image](./featured-image.png)

This project was created with [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev) and [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/). This project was developed for a curricular project.

The project uses [`Hands`](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands) module of MediaPipe

Note: The program only recognizes single hand, because `max_num_hands=1`

The program can identify following gestures:

- Zero/Fist/Stone
- One
- Two
- Three
- Four
- Five/Stop/Paper
- Middle finger
- Thumbs Up/Okay
- Rock On
- Yolo

Image gets blur when a middle finger is found
